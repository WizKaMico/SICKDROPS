       You may return your order for a refund or replacement to Clothing Shop Online within 30 days of the purchase date by visiting the returns page. You are responsible for inspecting the garments before performing any alterations or embellishments. Depending on the reason for your return, you may be responsible for shipping and handling charges. We highly recommend saving the receipt or tracking details verifying the return of your goods. If you have a problem or discrepancy (including shortages, damages, etc.) with an order contact us within 72 hours of receiving goods. Please note we are not able to accommodate any style, color or size swap or exchange requests via a replacement order. Items that have been printed, washed, decorated and masks which are final sale items are not eligible for return.<br><br>

       Our warehouse typically takes between 5-7 business days to process a return after being received. Once the return has been processed by our warehouse a credit will be issued to your original payment method within 5-7 business days. In total this entire process can take up to 14 business days. Be sure to save your proof of postage until your return is completed.<br><br>
